- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed and accessible from the command line.

### Building the Project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lindblomsebastian/gcmgen.git
cd gcmgen
cargo build --release
```

This builds the executable in `target/release/`.

## Usage

### Initialize API Key

Set up your API key and choose a service:

```sh
gcmgen --init
```

### Generate a Commit Message
